# Keven-Encryption-Benchmarking
The Encryption Benchmarking Tool is designed to evaluate and compare various encryption algorithms
based on key performance metrics such as speed, memory usage, and energy consumption.
This tool helps demonstrate the trade-offs between performance and security across different
encryption techniques, providing insights into which algorithms may be best suited for specific applications and environments.

The algorithms benchmarked include:

AES 
RSA 
ECC
