# Keven-Encryption-Benchmarking
An Encryption Benchmarking Tool is designed to evaluate and compare various encryption algorithms
based on key performance metrics such as speed, memory usage, and energy consumption.
This tool helps demonstrate the trade-offs between performance and security across different
encryption techniques, providing insights into which algorithms may best suit specific applications and environments.

The algorithms benchmarked include:

- AES 
- RSA 
- ECC 

running program: `poetry run encryption_benchmark --file-path /home/duverglas01/CMPSC-403/Keven-Encryption-Benchmarking/test.jpg --algorithm AES --rounds 5`
